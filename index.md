## Million Token

ðŸŒ• Million Token is a digital currency of fixed-supply (**1,000,000 coins total**) created by [TechLead](https://www.youtube.com/techlead), an ex-Google / ex-Facebook tech lead with over 1m+ subscribers on YouTube. This project was founded by July 2021.

The token has a few unique properties:

**Fixed Limited Supply** - Million Token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000 total coins in total. No more can ever be minted (as guaranteed by the token contract). MillionToken is deflationary by nature and theoretically gains value over time as scarcity increases.

**Millionaire-approved** - The token is backed and promoted by millionaire TechLead (who has over a million subscribers on YouTube). As the token gains popularity amongst more and more people, it gains liquidity and usage as a form of digital currency spreading exponentially through word of mouth. With popularity, the value of the token also grows.

**Ethereum Blockchain** - Million Token exists as an ERC-20 smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, decentralized and validated by millions of computers worldwide.
