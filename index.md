<h3>Million Concept</h3>
  Million Token is a stablecoin pre-mined to a fixed supply of 1,000,000 tokens pegged to a minimum of $1.00 USD per token (with no maximum value). 
<BR><BR>
As Million Token gains popularity and usage, the value of the token may increase above the initial peg-value of $1.00 USD.  For example, if 1000 people each want 1000 tokens, the fair market value of the token is $1.00 USD each. If 2000 people each want 1000 tokens, the fair market value of the token rises to $2.00 USD, thereby increasing the market cap of Million Token to $2 million.  Over time, the price of Million Token may reach $10 million, $100 million, or higher.

  <h3> Million Properties</h3>
Million Token has some unique properties.

* **1,000,000 Fixed Limited Supply** - Million Token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000 tokens total. No more can ever be created (guaranteed by code). Million Token is deflationary by nature.  The token begins with a peg of $1.00 USD per coin, and its value increases over time with scarcity.
* **$1+ Million Dollar Valuation** - With one million tokens in circulation, Million Token is worth a **minimum** of $1,000,000 USD total market capitalization but can be worth much more.
* **Moonshot Upside**.  For investors of Million Token, there is unlimited upside.  Unlike traditional stablecoins (pegged to $1 USD = 1 Token), Millon Token has a fixed supply and therefore has an unbound maximum.  As the token gains popularity and circulation, it could potentially reach higher values being worth as much as $10 million or $100 million theoretically. The moon is the limit.
* **Millionaire Approved** - The token is founded and backed by millionaire TechLead (with a million subscribers on YouTube). As the token gains popularity amongst more and more people, it gains usage and acceptance as a form of digital currency spreading exponentially through word of mouth. With popularity, the value of the token grows.
* **Store of Value + Transactional Currency**.  As a decentralized token secured by millions of computers worldwide on the Ethereum blockchain, Million Token can be used as both a store of value and a means of transaction.  The token's unique limited supply makes it especially ideal as a store of value with unlimited upside.  Million Token can be transferred in fractional amounts (up to 18 decimals), allowing it to be used for microtransactions as well.
* **Ethereum Blockchain** - Million Token exists as an ERC-20 smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, decentralized and validated by millions of computers worldwide.
